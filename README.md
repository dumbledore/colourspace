# Colourspace
_Colourspace_ is a Python library and viewer tool used to render videos and
images in the proper colourspace using the colorspace _FFmpeg_ filter.

It uses the _av_ package to access FFmpeg functionality, and _pymediainfo_
to obtain file and stream metadata, that is not yet available through _av_
(even though it _is_ available in FFmpeg).
